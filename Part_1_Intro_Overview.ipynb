    "This is the first of a series of posts in which I plan to talk about a real world prediction problem,\n",
    "predicting the change in one of the monthly government macro economic values.\n",
    "In particular, I will look at predicting the change in the number of people working for US private employers in a given month.\n",
    "The number of people working in the US is compiled by the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics,\n",
    "<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bls.gov/\">BLS</a>, and is published monthly\n",

    "The value published is an estimate of people employed\n",
    "in the prior month.  For example, the value published on Friday 2020-10-02 gives an estimate\n",
    "of the number of people employed in September 2020. \n",

    "The unemployment numbers come from a survey of households and the jobs numbers\n",
    "come from a survey of businesses.\n",
    "For the jobs number there is an aggregate value, i.e. for the entire US, and then breakdowns into private versus government\n",
    "and then many further breakdowns by industry type and other things.\n",
    " Suffice it to say that there is a lot of data in the report but I am only going to focus on\n",
    " the number of <em> private </em> jobs added in a month. The reason to focus on private and not the sum of private and government\n",
    " is becuase of some other data I want to use and it only covers private jobs.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Why do this?  For me it's to practice data science with real data on an important problem.\n",
    "The jobs number is one of the measures of the health of the economy.\n",
    "I'm writing this in October 2020 with a presidential election coming next month.\n",
    "The report released on October 2nd got a lot of attention in the press.\n",
    "Both the stock and bond markets pay attention to the releases too.\n",
    "Back in 2007 I worked in the investment group of a large bank and I recall that when the numbers\n",
    "came out, usually around 8:30 AM New York time, they were announced for all the traders to hear.\n",
